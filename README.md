<h1>Network Tool Suite</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The Network Tool Suite is a C++ program designed to assist network administrators and engineers in various tasks related to IP addressing, subnetting, and conversion between different formats. It includes functionalities for IPv4 and IPv6 addressing, subnetting, binary and hexadecimal conversions, and more.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>C++</b> 

<h2>Features</h2>

- <b>IPv4 and IPv6 support</b>
  - Users can choose between IPv4 and IPv6 addressing versions to perform their desired operations.
- <b>Subnetting Calculator</b>
  - The program includes a subnetting calculator capable of determining subnet details based on user-provided inputs such as the number of required hosts and the network address.
- <b>Binary Conversion</b>
  - Users can convert IPv4 addresses from dotted decimal notation to binary representation and vice versa. This feature aids in understanding the binary structure of IP addresses.
- <b>Hexadecimal Conversion</b>
  - The tool supports conversion between IPv6 addresses and hexadecimal notation, facilitating compatibility with IPv6 addressing schemes.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Upon launching the program, users are prompted to select the Internet Protocol version they wish to work with (IPv4 or IPv6). Based on their choice, they can then access various functionalities such as subnetting, binary conversion, and hexadecimal conversion.

<h2>Implementation</h2>
The program is implemented in C++ and utilizes standard libraries for input/output operations, string manipulation, and mathematical calculations. It employs modular design principles, with separate functions dedicated to specific tasks such as subnetting class A, B, and C networks, binary conversion, hexadecimal conversion, as well as IPv4 and IPv6 functionality.
